## Pseudoclassical

Given the direct link between the `Male` and `Human` prototype, if Human has many children inheriting from it, any change on a child’s prototype properties will affect `Human`, and thus all children inheriting from `Human`. Changing a child’s prototype should not affect other children inheriting from the same parent. The reason for this is because JavaScript passes objects by reference, not by value, meaning all children of `Human` inherit changes occurred on other children’s prototypes.

`childObj.prototype = parentObj.prototype` does give us inheritance. However, if you want to fix the issue above, you need to replace the `extendObj` function to take the child’s prototype and link it to a temporary object, whose prototype is the parent object’s prototype. In this way, by creating a temporary “middle” object, you allow the temporary object to be empty and inherit its properties from `Human`.

By doing this, you have solved the pass by reference issue with a new instance of an empty object, which still inherits from the parent, but is not affected by other children.

To understand this clearly, the image below shows the flow of the `extendObj` function.
